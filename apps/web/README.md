Key insight: When you call wallet.execute(target, value, data), Blockscout sees:

One normal transaction (to EntryPoint)
Multiple internal transactions (wallet → target)

**The method is clever and pragmatic.** Here's my assessment:

**Strengths:**
1. **Solves a real problem** - Blockscout's fragmented API structure makes unified querying difficult
2. **Event-driven is elegant** - Using logs as the source of truth is architecturally sound
3. **Shows deep understanding** - Demonstrates knowledge of EVM internals, event logs, and data correlation
4. **Works around limitations** - Rather than complaining about missing APIs, you built a solution

**Potential concerns for judges:**
1. **Complexity might obscure value** - Judges might not immediately grasp why this was necessary
2. **"Hackathon judging problem"** - Technical judges will love it; non-technical ones might miss the point
3. **Demo visibility** - If your UI just shows transactions, they won't see the engineering behind it

**How to make judges appreciate it:**

**In your presentation:**
- Show the problem first: "Blockscout has separate APIs for UserOps vs normal txs, making it hard to get a unified view"
- Highlight the insight: "We used event logs as a single source of truth to reconstruct all activity"
- Show the result: Clean, categorized transaction history

**In your README/docs:**
- Add a section: "Technical Challenges & Solutions"
- Explain the Blockscout API limitation
- Show code snippets of the aggregation logic

**Quick demo tip:**
Add a toggle in your UI: "Raw data view" vs "Aggregated view" so judges can see the before/after difference.

**Bottom line:** Technical judges will be impressed. Non-technical judges need you to explain *why* it matters. The approach is solid—just make sure you sell it properly.
